5-3: Prove by induction that there is a unique path between any pair of verticies in a tree.

Base case: If a tree has only two nodes (a root and a leaf), there is only one path from the root to the leaf.
N+1: If we add another leaf (either to the root or to the previous leaf), it will only be connected to a single parent, therefore it will have only one path.
