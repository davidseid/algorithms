5-7: 
Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counterexample. Repeat the problem if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.

Traversals given tree: 
    1
   / \
  2   3

Pre-order traversal: 1 -> 2 -> 3
In-order traversal: 2 -> 1 -> 3
Post-order traversal: 2 -> 3 -> 1

Algorithm given pre-order and in-order traversals:
In pre-order traversals, the parent comes before the children, whereas in-order traversal has the parent come between the children. We can leverage this insight to construct the binary tree with the following algorithm. 

For each node in the pre-order, treat it as a parent. Then split the in-order list at that parent to create the left and right subtrees. Recursively proceed, taking the next two nodes in the pre-order list as the left and right children and as the new parents from respective subtrees.

Algorithm given pre-order and post-order traversals:
This is not necessarily possible, given some ambiguity that would only be clarified by in-order traversal.
