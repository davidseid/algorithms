5-7: 
Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counterexample. Repeat the problem if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.

Traversals

Given tree: 
    1
   / \
  2   3

Pre-order traversal: 1 -> 2 -> 3
In-order traversal: 2 -> 1 -> 3
Post-order traversal: 2 -> 3 -> 1
