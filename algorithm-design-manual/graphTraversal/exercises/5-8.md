Present correct and efficient algorithms to convert an undirected graph G between the following graph data structures. You must give the time complexity of each algorithm, assuming n vertices and m edges.

a) Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists.

In an adjacency matrix is a square matrix wherein each dimension contains all n vertices. A cell is 1 if the two vertices are adjacent (i.e. connected by an edge), and 0 if not. An adjacency list can be represented as a hashmap, where the keys are the vertices and the values are lists of adjacent vertices.

Therefore, a possible algorithm:
Construct a hashmap, where the key will be the vertex and the value will be an array of adjacent vertices. Using nested loops, iterate through the adjacency matrix, creating a key for each vertex row and appending the column vertex in the value array for any cell that has a value of 1. The time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is in the worst case also O(n^2), in the event each vertex is adjacent to every other, then each value array in the adjacency list will have n vertices.
