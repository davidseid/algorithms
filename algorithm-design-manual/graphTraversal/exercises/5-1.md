5-1: 

a) For G1 and G2, report order of vertices encountered on a breadth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking vertices in alphabetical order.

G1: A -> B -> D -> I -> C -> J -> E -> G -> F -> H
G2: A -> B -> E -> C -> F -> I -> D -> G -> J -> M -> H -> K -> N -> L -> O -> P

b)  For G1 and G2, report order of vertices encountered on a depth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking vertices in alphabetical order.

G1: A -> B -> C -> E -> D -> G -> H -> F -> J -> I
G2: A -> B -> C -> D -> H -> G -> F -> E -> I -> J -> K -> L -> P -> O -> N -> M
