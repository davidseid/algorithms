5-5: Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite? 

Definitions: 
Chromatic number of a graph - the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices sahre the same color. 
Degree - number of edges that are incident (attached) to the vertex
Bipartite - a type of graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets (two colors). No two vertices within a set are adjacent.
