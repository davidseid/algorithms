5-5: Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite? 

Definitions: 
Chromatic number of a graph - the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices sahre the same color. 
Degree - number of edges that are incident (attached) to the vertex
Bipartite - a type of graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets (two colors). No two vertices within a set are adjacent.

Solution: 
The chromatic number of a graph can be computed with DFS traversal. Each child gets an opposite color of the parent, when we see a back edge, the current child gets a color different from the parent but also different from the ancestor discovered through the back edge. Single traversal occurs in linear time with respect to the number of edges and nodes. 

Such graphs need not be bipartite, for example they can be tripartite:

       red
      /   \
    blue - green
