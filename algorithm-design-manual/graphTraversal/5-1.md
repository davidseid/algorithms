5-1: 

a) For G1 and G2, report order of vertices encountered on a breadth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking vertices in alphabetical order.

G1: A -> B -> D -> I -> C -> E -> G -> I -> F -> H -> J
G2: A -> B -> E -> C -> F -> I -> D -> G -> J -> M -> H -> K -> N -> L -> O -> P
