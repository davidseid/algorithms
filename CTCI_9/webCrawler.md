# Web Crawler System Design

### Prompt
Design a web crawler application that recursively checks links for a particular domain, and checks images and links to other domains using HEAD requests (which don't return data). 

Make sure to avoid infinite loops.

### Considerations
- Discuss Scope, Assumptions, Components, Bottlenecks, Redesign
- Address failure, security, reliability, maintainability, and scalability
- Do back of envelope calculations and reference algorithms
